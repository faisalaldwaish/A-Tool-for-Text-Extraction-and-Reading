# A Tool for Text Extraction and Reading

## Project Overview
This project showcases a bilingual AI tool built using Hugging Face pipelines for tasks such as text summarization, translation, and text-to-speech conversion. The tool supports both English and Arabic, aiming to explore the capabilities of Hugging Face models in natural language processing (NLP), text-to-audio conversion, and audio transcription.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of input text using advanced Hugging Face models.
- **Translation**: Translates summarized English text into Arabic.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text (both English and Arabic) to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribes uploaded audio files into text using the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 models.

## Models and Pipelines
This project employs the following Hugging Face models and tools for different tasks:

### Text Summarization
- **Model**: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
- **Explanation**: BART is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained for multiple language tasks. It excels at abstractive text summarization, making it suitable for summarizing long documents coherently and effectively.

### Translation
- **Model**: `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar`
- **Explanation**: Part of the OPUS-MT project, this model is trained specifically for translating between English and Arabic. It is chosen for its high accuracy in generating grammatically correct translations.

### Text-to-Speech
- **Library**: `gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)`
- **Explanation**: gTTS is lightweight and supports multiple languages, including English and Arabic. It offers a simple yet effective way to convert text into speech.

### Audio Transcription
- **English Model**: `openai/whisper-base`
- **Arabic Model**: `jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-arabic`
- **Explanation**: Whisper is a state-of-the-art model for speech recognition, providing high accuracy for English transcription. For Arabic, Wav2Vec2 is a leading model in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and offers excellent performance in transcribing Arabic speech.

## Justification for Model and Pipeline Choices
- **Text Summarization (BART)**: The `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model is tuned for abstractive summarization, making it robust and suitable for generating coherent summaries in English.
  
- **Translation (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar)**: This model is highly effective for bilingual applications, ensuring high-quality translations between English and Arabic for a broad range of inputs.
  
- **Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: Chosen for its ease of use and multi-language support, gTTS efficiently converts both English and Arabic text into speech.
  
- **Audio Transcription (Whisper & Wav2Vec2)**: Whisper offers superior accuracy for English transcription, including diverse accents, while Wav2Vec2 is a cutting-edge model fine-tuned for Arabic speech recognition, ensuring high accuracy in transcription.
