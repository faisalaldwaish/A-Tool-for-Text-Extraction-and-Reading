# A Tool for Text Extraction and Reading

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive tool for text summarization, translation, text-to-speech (TTS), and audio transcription. It enables users to summarize text in English, translate it into Arabic, and listen to the summaries in both languages. Additionally, it allows users to upload audio files and transcribe them into text. The interface is designed using Gradio, making it user-friendly and accessible.

## Expected Outputs

1. **Text Summarization**:
   - English Summary: Summarized version of the input text in English.
   - Arabic Summary: Translated and summarized version of the English summary.

2. **Audio Outputs**:
   - English Summary Audio: An audio file (MP3) of the English summary.
   - Arabic Summary Audio: An audio file (MP3) of the Arabic summary.

3. **Audio Transcription**:
   - Transcribed Text: Text extracted from uploaded audio files in either Arabic or English.

## Model Choices

1. **Text Summarization**:
   - **Model**: [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)
   - **Justification**: This model is based on the BART architecture, which excels in generating high-quality summaries. It has shown strong performance in various summarization tasks, making it a suitable choice for generating coherent and concise summaries.

2. **Translation**:
   - **Model**: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar)
   - **Justification**: This translation model effectively translates English text into Arabic, ensuring the summaries retain their meaning across languages.

3. **Text-to-Speech**:
   - **English TTS**: Utilizes `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for English summaries.
   - **Arabic TTS**: Uses a separate TTS model for Arabic audio generation (can be changed to a Hugging Face model if preferred).
   - **Justification**: The chosen methods for TTS are known for their clear and natural-sounding voice outputs, enhancing the user experience.

4. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**:
   - **Arabic ASR Model**: [jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-arabic](https://huggingface.co/jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-arabic)
   - **English ASR Model**: [openai/whisper-base](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base)
   - **Justification**: These models are optimized for transcribing speech to text, providing accurate outputs for both Arabic and English audio.

## Pipeline Explanations

1. **Summarization Pipeline**: The project first summarizes the input text using the BART model. It then proceeds to translate the English summary into Arabic if required.

2. **Text-to-Speech Pipeline**: The summarized text is converted into audio files using the TTS models for both languages, enabling users to listen to the summaries.

3. **Audio Transcription Pipeline**: Uploaded audio files are processed using the ASR models to extract spoken content into text, allowing users to easily convert their audio files into written form.

## Special Measures for Arabic Language Support

- **Translation Model**: A dedicated translation model is employed to ensure the accuracy and fluency of translations from English to Arabic.
- **Arabic ASR Model**: A model specifically designed for Arabic speech recognition is used to enhance the transcription accuracy of Arabic audio files.
- **Language Options**: The user interface provides clear options for language selection, ensuring that the functionality is easily accessible for both English and Arabic speakers.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio transformers gtts
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. Access the Gradio interface through the provided link in the terminal.

## Conclusion

This tool aims to bridge the gap between English and Arabic language users by providing seamless summarization, translation, and audio functionalities. It showcases the potential of modern NLP techniques in enhancing accessibility and communication across languages.
